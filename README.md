# Book-Points
Software Engineering Project 
# Project Overview  
**BookPoints** is a web application designed to help Gaza university students exchange academic resources such as textbooks and software in a simple, affordable, and community-driven way.  
The system uses a **points-based exchange model**, where students earn points by sharing resources and spend points when borrowing resources.  

# Motivation

-  **Registration & Login** – Students can sign up and access their profile.  
-  **Unified Role** – Each student can both provide and request resources.  
-  **Search & Filter** – Find books or flash drives quickly.
